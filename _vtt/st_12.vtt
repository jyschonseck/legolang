Kind: captions

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:13.172
The book we're reading today is the vegetables we eat

2
00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:17.988
Shakira O'Lair volunteers for the Reading Connection in Washington D.C. 

3
00:00:18.064 --> 00:00:23.496
Her assignment: get these three girls excited about reading, and vegetables.  

4
00:00:23.612 --> 00:00:26.032
Some seeds and vegetables grow in pods, 

5
00:00:26.148 --> 00:00:28.316
sometimes the pods are eaten too

6
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.532
Reading with enthusiasm is a great start

7
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.752
non-fiction books with interesting facts and bright vivid pictures

8
00:00:35.828 --> 00:00:40.220
help kids get excited about science and other subjects they learn about in school. 

9
00:00:40.532 --> 00:00:42.060
What kind of vegetables do you see here?

10
00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:46.492
I see, I see ... peppers, tomatoes and, ... corn

11
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.848
Turns out Shakira has got a good crowd. 

12
00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:51.232
She encourages their participation, 

13
00:00:51.328 --> 00:00:53.836
which is great for their comprehension skills. 

14
00:00:54.836 --> 00:00:56.104
Oh! I make it in the garden!

15
00:00:56.788 --> 00:00:57.932
Do you guys have a garden?

16
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.508
Yes, right there ... Even two off there. 

17
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.380
Yes, right there ... Even two off there. We have strawberries that's growing by now, we have pumpkins.'

18
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.812
Stephany Berman is the programme manager at the Reading Connection. 

19
00:01:09.192 --> 00:01:13.124
They are asking the child questions about what they are encountering, 

20
00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:18.612
term familiar words and helping the child relate the buck to their everyday experience.

21
00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:20.816
There are eight groups of vegetables.

22
00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:23.732
Always remember to read with expression,  

23
00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:26.040
 not only because it makes reading exciting 

24
00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:29.108
but also because it provides a model of fluent reading.

25
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.468
It is good for us to eat vegetables. 

26
00:01:31.632 --> 00:01:35.556
They are nutritious and help keep our body strong and healthy 

27
00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:37.608
That's carrots, they keep our eyes ... strong 

28
00:01:38.168 --> 00:01:39.048
That's right!' 

29
00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:41.644
The vocabulary that's in picture books is 

30
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.560
often different than the vocabulary that's used in conversation, 

31
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.676
so it really helps to build vocabulary.' 

32
00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:50.796
Fruit, seed, stem, tuber. 

33
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.372
Which one is this one?

34
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.184
 A beet

35
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.184
A root !

36
00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.924
After reading aloud together, 

37
00:01:56.924 --> 00:02:00.304
After reading aloud together, the kids participate in a hands-on activity about farming. 

38
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.752
 This is a great way to use real-life experiences 

39
00:02:03.868 --> 00:02:05.980
to reinforce what kids have just learned. 

40
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.284
Hands-on activities connected to a book 

41
00:02:08.284 --> 00:02:10.280
 are really important because they help a child 

42
00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:14.248
make a personal connection with the subject they are reading about. 

43
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.084
And it builds up personal, personal knowledge,

44
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.804
 that background knowledge that then helps them when they experience a topic in the future.

45
00:02:21.868 --> 00:02:25.276
 You see, I do one side, and then I do the other side

46
00:02:25.664 --> 00:02:27.452
 you see, you try it, OK? 

47
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.928
Here you go. See ? Good job ! Look at that!

48
00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:34.700
This activity gives kids a glimpe of life on a dairy farm. 

49
00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.436
 It also explains how the process of making milk 

50
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.696
 starts with a cow and ends in our refrigirators.

51
00:02:41.408 --> 00:02:44.296
You got it. Oh here you go ! Woooh!!  

52
00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:48.480
All right! Oh no !!! It's getting down on you. 

53
00:02:49.176 --> 00:02:49.888
Who's next?

54
00:02:50.284 --> 00:02:51.880
Are you guys ready to pasteurize? 

55
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.460
 Did you get that milk in the bucket?

56
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.532
This is our milk from our cow. 

57
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.464
 Put it in there.

58
00:02:57.648 --> 00:03:00.340
'You got more milk? Oh oh ... Tell me what I'm supposed to do? ...

59
00:03:00.404 --> 00:03:02.340
Tell me what I'm supposed to do? 

60
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.400
 You hold this right here over this big fire 

61
00:03:05.848 --> 00:03:06.548
What is that?

62
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.580
 It's ... It's pasteurizing, we're making milk 

63
00:03:09.632 --> 00:03:11.204
What we are doing when we are pasteririzing, 

64
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.348
is we are heating it up to kill the germs in it.' 

65
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.536
Oh! now look!

66
00:03:14.604 --> 00:03:16.376
So we can sell it at the store!

67
00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:19.008
Yes, our farm day has ended.

68
00:03:19.272 --> 00:03:23.400
Even though the lesson about farms has ended for the kids at the Reading Connection, 

69
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.232
 you can bring this and other topics to life life at home 

70
00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:29.344
by sharing read alouds and other activities with your family. 

71
00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:34.280
