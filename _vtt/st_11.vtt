00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:15.869
MOFIÉ,

2
00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:18.560
I was obese, and that was sort of a wake up call.

3
00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:20.212
I was trying to figure out what could

4
00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:23.062
I do to make it so that I could get some exercise into my daily life.

5
00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:25.289
I borrowed a bike from a friend one day

6
00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:27.382
and it seemed pretty good here in Queens,

7
00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:30.799
so a few days later I went into the city and I bought a bike,

8
00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:33.613
rode it home and I've been riding back and forth to work ever since.

9
00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:35.374
The ride takes me about 40 minutes.

10
00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:37.451
My subway commute was also about 40 minutes,

11
00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:40.032
so I'm getting an hour and 20 minutes of exercise every day.

12
00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:44.765
When the Daily News did an article on me I thought it was kind

13
00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:47.762
of funny and I had actually gone on vacation

14
00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:50.335
so I came home and the internet had blown up.

15
00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.702
The article said, you know, I'd lost 30 pounds and as of yesterday

16
00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:55.517
I've now lost 45 pounds.

17
00:00:57.148 --> 00:01:00.147
I know of seven people who have since taken up bike riding again

18
00:01:00.183 --> 00:01:01.543
since I started riding.

19
00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:03.172
I'm not sure if I'm an inspiration

20
00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:04.127
or they just saw me doing it,

21
00:01:04.178 --> 00:01:05.003
it was sort of a catalyst

22
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.963
for them to do what they'd already been planning to do.

23
00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.673
Marcus was a real inspiration to me.

24
00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:10.791
Last month I went out and bought my bicycle

25
00:01:10.823 --> 00:01:13.075
and I've been commuting to work almost every day since.

26
00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:15.249
It's been really inspiring to get in shape myself.

27
00:01:15.296 --> 00:01:18.197
If he can do it, I can do too, so I bought a bike and here I am.

28
00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:20.612
I saw how much weight he had lost doing it

29
00:01:20.678 --> 00:01:22.607
and it just sounded like a really fun idea.

30
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.764
One of the bumpy spots in my old commute

31
00:01:24.812 --> 00:01:26.456
was riding across Queens Plaza.

32
00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.416
Riding a bike was always a bit nerve-wracking,

33
00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:30.098
navigating your way through that,

34
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.394
so I'm thrilled this city is finally building a protected bike

35
00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.438
and pedestrian path,

36
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.334
a way for people to get on and off that bridge.

37
00:01:38.326 --> 00:01:41.203
I love riding around the city.
I love watching the people,

38
00:01:41.282 --> 00:01:43.575
the buildings, going through the different neighbourhoods,

39
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:46.013
watching the seasons change, the people change.

40
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.922
It's a really magical experience.
